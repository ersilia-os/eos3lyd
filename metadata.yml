Title: Efflux pump avoidance in gram-negative bacteria
Description: Using Co-ADD data on E.coli inhibition (WT, TolC efflux deficient 
  and lpxC hyperpermable strains) 73k compounds were classified as inactive, 
  efflux evaders and efflux substrates, based on the relative inhibition of 
  wild-type vs permeable strains. We have used the efflux evaders (186) and 
  efflux substrates (554) data to train a model that predicts the probability of
  a molecule being an efflux evader.
