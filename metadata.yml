Title: Efflux pump avoidance in gram-negative bacteria
Description: Data from Co-ADD related to wild-type Escherichia coli, the efflux-deficient
  tolC strain, and the hyper-permeable lpxC strain were used to define efflux evaders
  and substrates, based on the relative inhibition of wild-type vs permeable strains.
  In the study, the learned patterns of efflux evasion were used to optimize matched
  molecular pairs.
